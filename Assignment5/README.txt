This assignment was meant for us to learn how to work with OpenCv and its face detection functions. You are required to not only detect
but also track the face on the screen. I chose Angela Merkel since she looks straight in the camera, while still moving and talking.
I got rid of most of my false positives. On my machine the mouth was still having one more false positives at a time but nothing else. That is
why I added another mp4 video to this directory. However, on the SoC the face itself is having issues for some reason and I could not figure out why
it was not working.
It was really fun to work with these functions and actually have a kind of working Face Recognition code.

Instructions:
    python facescanner.py
