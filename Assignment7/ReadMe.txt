This assignment was a bit more difficult for me than the last one. I think I understood the basic idea on what this assignment was meant to teach me. I think I was on the right track but I was getting multiple syntax errors when drawing the lines of opencv which I could not figure out. 
I did use the chessboard again to make sure that my matrix and distortion coefficients are as accurate as possible. So I ran the same video on my Assignment 6 again to get the most accurate csv files. 
I was having a really hard time with the rectangle or the 4 lines to be drawn to represent the rectangle. However, I have found a way to draw these lines but when I go turn the board upside down it does not quite get the right way. I could not figure out how to do it differently, but I am sure that there would have been another way. 

Instructions:
    python Asg7.py
